A tool to collect Yellowstone's library of nature sounds

Yellowstone Nation Park released an audio sample library!

Unfortunately for me, each sample is downloadable from it's own webpage.
There's nowhere to get them all at once.

So I made a scraper, to visit each link, and download each sample. Yay!
Now we can have nice things.
